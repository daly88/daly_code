Introduction
-------------------------

XCoverage is a test coverage web application for script language.
It is written by Python.
It consists:
  1. script parser to specific script language (top-down code block parser)
  2. coverage result persentation
  3. simple QC and coder authentication and permission management 

How it works
-------------------------
In order to get the script test coverage result, hack the script 
virtual machine code, add hook code in opcode interpretor. (modify 
script engine source)
The script of application to be tested, we call target application.

The whole test process:
1. create a Test task in target application
2. run script in target application
3. generate coverage result(XML file in our format)
4. send to repository by Http interface
5. check the result in web page.

This application code include step 4 and 5. the Test task metadata 
shared by our apps and target application via MySQL.

Run enviornment
--------------------------
1. MySQL DB
2. Python 2.6
3. nginx web server + uwsgi (recommended)
4. Jquery (already put in our source code)
